# Contributing
If you want to contribute, you can **try to understand requests and responses**: search in the code for "TODO: Missing" and "TODO: What's this?", you'll find a lot of entries. This means that I wasn't able to identify what that parameter was for. You can have better luck so if you find out what it's for **create an issue**.
